# Building & testing

## Device build (armhf, the one that matters)

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm/v7 \
  -v "$PWD":/work \
  debian:bookworm bash /work/pc/build-armhf-docker.sh
```

Output `pc/build-armhf/bin/AnimalCrossing` (ELF 32-bit ARM EABI5 hard-float).
Build dir persists on the host mount → incremental. The script also sets the
target tuning flags (`-mcpu=cortex-a53 -mfpu=neon-vfpv4 -mfloat-abi=hard`)
and runs an in-container smoke attempt (its xvfb run may fail on missing
xauth — that's the container, not the binary; use the harness instead).

**Colima/docker gotcha**: `exec format error` from an arm container means
qemu binfmt handlers aren't registered in the colima VM — run
`docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm` once per VM
(2026-07-15). Also: legacy builder (no buildx) silently ignores
`--platform` when an arm64 base image is cached. Verify any image/container
with `uname -m` → must print `armv7l`. `acgc-smoke-deps:armhf` was once
silently arm64 and had to be rebuilt via `docker commit` from an explicit
`--platform linux/arm/v7` container.

## Test harness (`harness/`)

- `./harness/smoke.sh armhf` — boots the real binary + rom headless in
  Docker (image `acgc-smoke-deps:armhf`), 120s; PASS = survived past disc
  load, log at `harness/out/armhf-smoke.log`. **Run this after every build.**
- `./harness/smoke.sh arm64` — same for the arm64 GLES build.
- `./harness/run-native.sh` — macOS native build, fastest iteration loop.
- Rom: `harness/rom/Animal Crossing.iso` (GAFE01 USA, 1459978240 bytes).
  Git-ignored. **Never commit anything under harness/rom/.**
- `./harness/check-launcher-sync.sh` — normalized diff of the three launcher
  .sh copies (GAMEDIR/PORT_32BIT lines intentionally differ). Run before
  every release package.
- `./harness/inspect-gci.py <gci>` — save forensics (equipment/pockets dump).
- Verifying the shader disk cache end-to-end: run smoke twice; second run's
  log must show `[PC/TEV] Preloaded N shader(s) from disk cache`
  (cache file lands in `pc/build-armhf/bin/shader_cache.bin`).
- Verifying resolution auto-detect in smoke (2026-07-15): comment out
  `window_width/height/size` in `pc/build-armhf/bin/settings.ini` and set
  `fullscreen = 1` → log must show `[Settings] Auto-detected display WxH`
  (Xvfb screen is 1280x1024 → window_size=6 custom). Restore the ini after.
  Smoke can NOT exercise gameplay paths (no scripted input) — shovel-dupe
  stow, clock long-run, and dpad-on-stickless remain device/human tests.

## Desktop/macOS build

**Tier 1 does not work on Apple Silicon** (verified 2026-07-29): pc/CMakeLists.txt:41
fatal-errors on any 64-bit configure ("This project MUST be built as 32-bit
(pointer-to-u32 casts in JSystem)"), and Homebrew gcc on arm64 macOS has no
32-bit target, so `harness/run-native.sh` (and any bare `cmake ..` in pc/build)
dies at configure. There is also no `build_pc.sh` in the tree — kb said there
was; it doesn't exist. Use the armhf Docker build for compile checks; an
`ac_haniwa` one-TU change plus link took ~4 min under QEMU.
Tier 2 (`pc/build-linux-arm64-gles`) still holds a working **64-bit** aarch64
binary, but its CMakeCache dates from 2026-07-12 — a fresh configure there
would hit the same guard, so don't wipe that build dir expecting it to come
back (why the guard and the merged upstream 64-bit work coexist is unresolved).

Apple linker guards live in pc/CMakeLists.txt
(`--version-script`/`--allow-multiple-definition` are GNU-ld-only) and
pc/src/pc_stubs.c (`#ifndef __APPLE__` cKF stubs).

Docker gotchas seen again 2026-07-29:
- binfmt registration is lost on **every** `colima start`, not just on VM
  creation — `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install arm`
  again or the armhf container exits `exec /usr/bin/bash: exec format error`.
- Don't pipe the build through `| tail` — nothing is flushed until the
  container exits, so a 4-minute build looks hung. Redirect to a file (or
  `tee`) if you want progress.

## Compile flags (don't regress)

- `CMAKE_C(XX)_FLAGS_RELEASE` in pc/CMakeLists.txt carries **no -O** —
  these overrides replace CMake's defaults entirely, and that is deliberate:
  decomp game code crashes at -O2 and SIGBUSes at -O1 on device (kb/perf.md
  "-O2 regression"). Speed comes from per-source -O2/-O3 on proven TUs.
- The UB-guard flags next to it (-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks etc.) exist
  because decomp code relies on UB; keep them when touching optimization.
- `pc_gx_texture.c` gets per-source -O3 (set_source_files_properties uses the
  `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/...` absolute form — must match how
  PC_SOURCES lists it).
- Game (decomp) code stays **unoptimized** — -O2 crash-loops and -O1
  SIGBUSes on device (see kb/perf.md "-O2 regression").

## Shader seed (pc/shaders/shader_seed.bin)

Keys-only copy of a shader_cache.bin (same header, per-entry blob length 0).
Compiled during the boot splash on first launch so gameplay never compiles a
known shader. Regenerate after content that introduces new TEV configs:
take a device shader_cache.bin that has seen the new content and strip the
blobs (each entry = 72-byte key + two u32 meta + blob; write meta {0,0} and
no blob; dedupe keys; keep the 12-byte header). Bump SDC_VERSION in
pc_gx_tev.c whenever ShaderKey layout or generated GLSL changes — that
invalidates both local caches and the seed format together.

## CI / releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml`: triggers ONLY on `v*` tags (+ manual
dispatch → artifact instead of release) to conserve private-repo Actions
minutes. QEMU + same docker script, ~1-3h. Packages via
`portmaster/make-package.sh` → zip with `Animal Crossing.sh` at root +
`ports/ac-gc/{AnimalCrossing,shaders/,rom/README.txt,libs.armhf/README.txt}`.
Release flow: merge dev→main, tag `vX.Y.Z` on main, push tag. Never tag dev.
Launcher sync rule: `port_files/Animal Crossing.sh` is source of truth;
`portmaster/Animal Crossing.sh` ships in the zip — keep in sync (a stale copy
once nearly shipped without the PipeWire audio fix).
