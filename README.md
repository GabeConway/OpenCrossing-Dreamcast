# OpenCrossing-Anbernic

Native ARM port of the Animal Crossing (GameCube) decompilation for Anbernic
H700 handhelds (RG-34XX SP, RG35XX/RG40XX family, RG28XX, CubeXX) running
muOS, Knulli, or other PortMaster-capable OSes. **This is not emulation**: the
game's original decompiled C code runs directly on the handheld's CPU, with a
translation layer mapping the GameCube's GX graphics API onto OpenGL ES 3.2.
Built on the [ac-decomp](https://github.com/ACreTeam/ac-decomp) project and
the PC ports it enabled — see [Credits](#credits).

Supported game version: `GAFE01` — Animal Crossing (USA), Rev 0.

## Install (muOS / PortMaster)

No build tools needed. You need: a PortMaster-capable device, a computer with
an SD card reader, and **your own legally-dumped copy** of Animal Crossing
(USA) as an `.iso` file.

1. **Download the release zip.** Go to the
   [latest release](../../releases/latest) and download
   `opencrossing-anbernic-vX.Y.Z-armhf.zip` (under "Assets").
2. **Unzip it** on your computer. Inside you'll find a folder called `ports`
   and a file called `Animal Crossing.sh`.
3. **Plug the device's SD card into your computer.**
4. **Copy the files onto the card:**
   - Copy the whole `ports` folder to the **root** of the SD card (next to
     folders like `ROMS`). If asked whether to merge or replace an existing
     `ports` folder, choose **merge**.
   - Copy `Animal Crossing.sh` into the `ROMS/Ports/` folder on the card.
5. **Add your game dump.** Copy your own `Animal Crossing.iso` (USA, game ID
   `GAFE01`) into `ports/ac-gc/rom/`. Without your disc image, nothing will
   start.
6. **Eject safely**, put the card back, power on, and launch
   **Animal Crossing** from the **Ports** menu.

The **first launch takes noticeably longer** — the game is building its
shader cache. Later launches are much faster. Assets are read straight from
the disc image (no extraction); saves, settings, and logs live in
`ports/ac-gc/`.

On Knulli that folder is `/userdata/roms/ports/ac-gc/` rather than
`/userdata/ports/ac-gc/` — the launcher resolves it either way, so put the
files wherever that firmware keeps its `ports` folder.

### Troubleshooting

- **"NO GAME DISC IMAGE FOUND" / "WRONG GAME VERSION" screen:** the port
  couldn't use your disc image — check that your iso is in
  `ports/ac-gc/rom/` and is the USA `GAFE01` version. `.iso`, `.gcm`, and
  `.ciso` all work. (Older builds showed a plain black screen or exited
  instantly in this situation.)
- **Black screen / instant exit** (without an error screen): attach
  `ports/ac-gc/log.txt` to a bug report — on current builds a missing or
  wrong iso is reported on-screen, so a silent black screen is something
  else.
- **No audio:** quit and relaunch once — the audio stack sometimes needs a
  second start after first install.
- **Can't walk / no analog stick:** current builds detect stickless
  controllers and enable D-pad walking automatically. On older builds (or
  to override): press **Select** → **Control** → set
  **"Use Dpad as Joystick"**.
- **Wrong resolution:** the port auto-detects your panel on launch; to force
  one, uncomment `window_width` / `window_height` in
  `ports/ac-gc/settings.ini`.
- **Modded stock OS:** Select and Menu keys are reversed (all PortMaster
  games there) — **Menu/Function** opens settings, **Select+Start** exits.
- **NES furniture says "I don't have any software":** expected — the NES
  emulator does not exist in this port (see [FAQ](#faq)). Not a bug with
  your files.
- **Lid sleep/wake weirdness (muOS clamshells):** known muOS firmware quirk,
  not the port — press the power button to wake.
- **Reporting a bug:** attach `ports/ac-gc/log.txt` — it's rewritten every
  launch and has the diagnostics we need.

## Supported devices

Developed on the **RG-34XX SP**; every H700 Anbernic shares the same chip
(quad Cortex-A53 + Mali-G31), so the same binary should run on all of them:

| Device | Screen | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RG-34XX SP | 720×480 (3:2) | ✅ Tested — the development device |
| RG34XX | 720×480 (3:2) | Same screen and chip as the SP; safest bet |
| RG35XX SP | 640×480 (4:3) | ✅ Community-tested — works great |
| RG35XX H | 640×480 (4:3) | ✅ Community-tested on **modded stock OS** |
| RG35XX Plus / 2024 / Pro | 640×480 (4:3) | ✅ Community-tested on **Knulli** — "perfectly stable" |
| RG40XX V | 640×480 (4:3) | ✅ Community-tested on **Knulli** (two reports) |
| RG40XX H | 640×480 (4:3) | ✅ Community-tested — "works seamless" |
| RG28XX | 640×480 (4:3) | ✅ Community-tested on **Knulli** |
| RG CubeXX | 720×720 (1:1) | Square panel — expect letterboxing |

Trying an untested one? Report the result (working or not) in an issue with
`ports/ac-gc/log.txt` attached. Non-H700 devices (older RG35XX models,
RK3566, etc.) are **not** expected to work.

## FAQ

- **Can I use the European (PAL) or Japanese disc?** No — the decompilation
  this port is built from targets the USA `GAFE01` version specifically,
  and the recompiled code expects that disc's exact data layout. PAL/JP
  discs are different software (different code, timing, text banks) and
  are detected and refused at launch with an on-screen message. Any
  legally-dumped USA copy works.
- **The gyroid at my door says "I am currently processing data" and never
  saves — is saving broken?** No, that message is the gyroid *declining* to
  save, not a progress bar (it ends with "Good luck with your part-time
  job" — press A to close it). Same as the GameCube original: until you
  finish Nook's part-time job errands, or talk to villagers until one
  remembers you, the gyroid won't offer to save. After your first real
  save it never appears again. If saving genuinely fails, `log.txt` shows
  a `GCI save:` line explaining why.
- **Do the NES games work?** No. The in-game NES emulator is PowerPC
  assembly in the original code and cannot run on these devices, so every
  NES furniture item shows *"I want to play my NES, but I don't have any
  software."* — including items that have a built-in game on GameCube.
  The rest of the furniture works normally. This may become an external-
  emulator feature someday, but it is not on the roadmap.
- **Does the Deluxe mod work?** Not yet — technically possible but a large
  amount of work; don't expect it soon.
- **Can other GameCube games be ported this way?** Only games with a complete
  decompilation — see [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev). A finished decomp
  makes a port possible, not guaranteed.
- **How much RAM?** Runs comfortably on both 2GB (RG34XX family) and 1GB
  (RG35XX / RG28XX family) devices.
- **Desktop Linux / PC?** That's the upstream project's target — see
  [Credits](#credits). This fork focuses on H700 handhelds.

## Settings, saves, texture packs

- **Settings:** everything is adjustable in the in-game settings menu (or
  `settings.ini`) — FPS target (fixed / unlimited / dynamic), render scale,
  shadow/particle/acre quality, distance culling, volume, bindings.
- **Saves:** standard GCI format, fully Dolphin-compatible both directions.
  Slot A is `ports/ac-gc/save/card_a/`, Slot B `save/card_b/`. With the game
  closed, manage `.gci` files directly: copy out = backup, delete = fresh
  town, drop a Dolphin export in = import. Back up before updating.
  Saves are checksum-validated at load: a hand-hex-edited save that
  doesn't recompute the Animal Crossing checksum is rejected (the game
  falls back to its `.bak` backups instead of crashing) — use a save
  editor that writes valid checksums.
- **Texture packs:** Dolphin-format (XXHash64 DDS) in `texture_pack/`. The
  [community HD pack](https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-animal-crossing-hd-texture-pack-version-23-feb-22nd-2026)
  works, with a performance cost on handheld GPUs.

## Building & branches

`main` is the release branch (tagged `vX.Y.Z`, CI-built zips on the
[Releases page](../../releases)); `dev` is daily development and may be
broken. Building is only needed for development — cross-build in Docker from
any machine:

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm/v7 \
  -v "$PWD":/work \
  debian:bookworm bash /work/pc/build-armhf-docker.sh
```

Output: `pc/build-armhf/bin/AnimalCrossing`. A desktop build (`build_pc.sh`)
also works for development; see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).
